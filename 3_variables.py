#Python Variables
#In programming, a variable is a container (storage area) to hold data. For example,

number = 10
print(number)

site_name = 'programiz.pro'
print((site_name))

# assigning a new value to site_name
site_name = 'apple.com'

print(site_name)

# Example: Assigning multiple values to multiple variables
a , b , c = 10, 20, "Hello"
print(a)
print(b)
print(c)

#assigning same value to multple variable 
x = y = "Google"
print(y + " + " + x)


# declare constants 
PI = 3.14
GRAVITY = 9.8
print (PI, GRAVITY)
