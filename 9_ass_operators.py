Python Assignment Operators
Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables. For example,
Operator	Name	Example
=	Assignment Operator	a = 7
+=	Addition Assignment	a += 1 # a = a + 1
-=	Subtraction Assignment	a -= 3 # a = a - 3
*=	Multiplication Assignment	a *= 4 # a = a * 4
/=	Division Assignment	a /= 3 # a = a / 3
%=	Remainder Assignment	a %= 10 # a = a % 10
**=	Exponent Assignment	a **= 10 # a = a ** 10

'''
# assign 5 to x 
x = 5

print(x)

# assign 10 to a
a = 10

# assign 5 to b
b = 5 

# assign the sum of a and b to a
a += b      # a = a + b

print(a)

# Output: 15
