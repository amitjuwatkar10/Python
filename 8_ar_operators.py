1. Python Arithmetic Operators
Arithmetic operators are used to perform mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, etc. For example,
Operator	Operation	Example
+	Addition	5 + 2 = 7
-	Subtraction	4 - 2 = 2
*	Multiplication	2 * 3 = 6
/	Division	4 / 2 = 2
//	Floor Division	10 // 3 = 3
%	Modulo	5 % 2 = 1
**	Power	4 ** 2 = 16

+ to add a and b
- to subtract b from a
* to multiply a and b
/ to divide a by b
// to floor divide a by b
% to get the remainder
** to get a to the power b


'''
a = 7
b = 2

# addition
print ('Sum: ', a + b)  

# subtraction
print ('Subtraction: ', a - b)   

# multiplication
print ('Multiplication: ', a * b)  

# division
print ('Division: ', a / b) 

# floor division
print ('Floor Division: ', a // b)

# modulo
print ('Modulo: ', a % b)  

# a to the power b
print ('Power: ', a ** b)
