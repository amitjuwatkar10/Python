!=	Not Equal To	3 != 5 gives us True
>	Greater Than	3 > 5 gives us False
<	Less Than	3 < 5 gives us True
>=	Greater Than or Equal To	3 >= 5 give us False
<=	Less Than or Equal To	3 <= 5 gives us True

a = 5

b = 2

# equal to operator
print('a == b =', a == b)

# not equal to operator
print('a != b =', a != b)

# greater than operator
print('a > b =', a > b)

# less than operator
print('a < b =', a < b)

# greater than or equal to operator
print('a >= b =', a >= b)

# less than or equal to operator
print('a <= b =', a <= b)
